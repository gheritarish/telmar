My name is Baptiste Marlet, aka telmar, and I am a backend engineer, currently working at
[PayLead](https://www.paylead.fr/).

This blog is to put thoughts on both development and role playing games, probably my main passion. I
might also bring some other stuff, with focus on what I do in my life.

If you came here, I hope you find it interesting.

## On this blog

This blog is built using [astro](https://astro.build/) with the [AstroPaper
theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). It is deployed using a basic
[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) config (basically, I clicked on the button available in [this
page](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/07/08/build-wicked-fast-sites-with-astro-an-introduction/)).
