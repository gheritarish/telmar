## Welcome here!

Welcome to Telmar's Brewery of Hacks! Whichever the reason that brought you to this part of the
internet, you are welcomed to stay.

You're probably wondering who I am, and why would I need a blog. Do I even need a place to write
random stuff?

Well, I don't expect to blow your mind every time, I don't even expect to teach new things. You
might ask why I write, then. I'll simply say that I will post here things that people might want to
find. Like I said, maybe they already know what they will find. But maybe I can teach them one or
two things from time to time.

## The content of this blog

So what will I even talk about?

There are two things you might want to know about me. First, I am a software developer. Second, I
love tabletop roleplaying games. And I intend to write about both of those.

What will I share? I honestly don't really know yet. I have ideas, of course, but nothing clearly
defined. Some thoughts about TTRPG systems, about how to improve the response time of an API... we
shall see.
